# Lab2 - Logistic Regression 
Created Logistic Regression machine learning model for Breast Cancer data set uploaded on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic). 
Model Gave accuracy of 98%. I initially built base model and later optimized the model with help of Gread Search Function and making model pipeline. 
Optimzed model gave best parameters as below : 
class_weight='balanced', random_state=100, solver='liblinear'
Best Parameters: {'clf__C': 0.1, 'clf__penalty': 'l2'}
