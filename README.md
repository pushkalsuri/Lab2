# Lab2-SVM
Created Support Vector machine learning model for Breast Cancer data set uploaded on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic). 
Model Gave accuracy of 97%. I initially built base model and later optimized the model with help of Gread Search Function and making model pipeline. 
Optimzed model gave best parameters as below :
Best Parameters: {'clf__C': 10, 'clf__gamma': 0.01, 'clf__kernel': 'rbf'}
